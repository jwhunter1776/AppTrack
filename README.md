While idle due to COVID-19, found many identical positions were being offered though different recruiting facilities. 
Rather than have to explain mistakenly applying to the position a second time, had decided to create a utility to track employment applications.

It is with the greatest hope this application may assist in the search for employment without a single embarrassing moment.
